//POSITIONAL PARAMETERS//

Easily pass values into a script

command <arg1> <arg2> <arg3> ... <argn> etc etc

cp ~/bin/script1.sh ~/archive/script1.sh

$# = total number of arguments
$@ = All arguments as a list
$* = all arguments as a single value

The above fucks up in osx too

shift - literally shifts arguments in a script. (Not really sure what I'd use this for yet)
