//SED//

sed -i.comment '/^#/d;/^$/d' /etc/ntp.conf

the d option here in reg ex, deletes

In the above segment, we are creating a backup copy of /etc/ntp.conf

-i.commented is creating the backup

Notice ; delimites a space between two separate commands /^#/d and /^$/d

sed 'p' /etc/passwd - print matching pattern and standard out. Will show each line twice. 
sed -n to suprress standard output







OS X sed handles the -i argument differently to the Linux version.

You can probably generate a command that will work for both by adding -e:

#      vv
sed -i -e 's|\(.*\)\.o:|$(OBJ_DIR)/\1.o $(OBJ_DIR)/\1.d $(TEST_OBJ_DIR)/\1_utest.o:|' $@
It's because OS X sed -i interprets the next thing after the -i as a file extension for a backup copy of the in-place edit. (Probably the Linux version only does this if there is no space between the -i and the extension.)

The upshot of this is that sed consumes the s||| as the extension (!) then interprets the next argument as a command - in this case it begins with t, which sed recognises as a branch-to-label command expecting the target label as an argument - hence the error you see.

If you create a file testyou can reproduce the error on OS X:

$ sed -i 's|x|y|' test
sed: 1: "test": undefined label 'est'
