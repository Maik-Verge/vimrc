Math
Math.random() - will generate a random number
.toLowerCase() - will turn all input into lower case letters so capitalization doesn't confuse
.push - will push things to the end of an array
.length - if you're using an array. Dot length will count how many items are in the array so that you can iterate over it without actually having to count how much shit is in the array.
setTimeout() - Timeout is measured in milliseconds. There are 1000 milliseconds in a second so waiting 2 seconds is the same as waiting 2000 milliseconds
2 seconds * 1000 = 2000 milliseconds

Variables are created using var. Variables cannot start with a number, contain spaces, or use a word that is already reserved for something else. It cannot use any punctuation except "_" or "$".

Math.round(Math.random() * 5 ); just know that you can do this

for(var i = 1; i <= 100; i++;){
if(i % 3 === 0){
	if(i % 5 ==== 0){
		console.log("This statement is divisible by 3 and 5");
	}
	else{
		console.log("Only divisible by the first parameter (3)");
	}
}
//Then if you need to include a response for when it's only divisible by 5
	else if(i%5===0){
		console.log("This is div by 5");
	}
else{
	console.log(i);
}
}
